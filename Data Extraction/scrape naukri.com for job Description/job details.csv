Future Focus Infotech was established in 1997 to leverage on the opportunity provided by the Y2K challenge that had to be resolved before the end of the millennium. It chose to meet the challenge by producing competent SW professionals with custom-made, rigorous short-term training program for engineers and computer graduates. Even as a start up company, it competed successfully with a host of established companies to be awarded the Business Associate status by TCS.Incorporated in October of the same year as a Private Limited company and rechristened Future Focus Infotech (FFI), it commenced its operations in Chennai and Bangalore, trained over 300 engineers, partnered with TCS in the successful execution of Y2K projects and concluded its first fiscal with a revenue of over INR 20 lakhs.As the Y2K skills requirement petered out, the year 1998-99 saw FFI venturing into e-commerce training. FFI also started providing solutions for consulting requirements from TCS and other smaller clients for skills other than Mainframe, viz. Web Technologies, Microsoft Client Server technologies, Java, Oracle and so on.It was during this phase that the FFI Management felt the need to enhance on the service offerings and foray deeper into the IT domain. This resulted in the establishment of a Software Development Centre to cater to domestic as well as overseas markets. The SDC in Chennai was inaugurated in 1999 and a few months later a second one in Bangalore was established. By the end of 1999-2000, these centers had over 50 software professionals executing projects for domestic clients like India Cements and Mistral and a few US based customers. This was the period which gave inception to our wholly owned subsidiary, Focus America, Inc. then based out of Georgia, Atlanta",https://www.naukri.com/job-listings-senior-software-engineer-replication-future-focus-infotech-pvt-ltd-bengaluru-bangalore-15-to-18-years-030620500114?src=jobsearchDesk&sid=1591974406629618&xp=12&px=5

Business Overview:
 
Veritas Technologies enables organizations to harness their information, bolstering business success in even the most complex environments. We serve organizations of all sizes, including 86 percent of global Fortune 500 companies. In fact, for over a decade, Veritas has been recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for both Enterprise Backup Software and Integrated Appliances and Enterprise Information Archiving. Together with our experienced partner community, we help our customers improve their data availability and unlock insights to make them more competitive.

Unlock the power of information. Our software and hardware products enable companies to protect, identify, and manage data within the world's largest and most complex environments-from traditional data centers to private, public, and hybrid clouds. Veritas helps enterprises address information management challenges with a complete, organized product strategy and roadmap focused on their needs. Our backup and recovery, business continuity, software-defined storage, and information governance products help keep businesses up and running so they can focus on what they do best. The need for Veritas has never been greater. Unchecked data growth is an expensive burden-and a potential security risk. 

With a majority of the world's enterprise data holding no legal, regulatory, or business value, the cost in time, money, and resources to store and manage it is staggering. But how do companies separate the valuable from the volume? Veritas solutions help them identify the needles of high-value information buried deep inside every corporate data haystack. Our approach to helping companies defy the data deluge is governed by three beliefs:
         Not all data is created equal. 
         Infrastructure availability does not equal business uptime. 
         Know what data you have, keep only the data you need. 
 
The majority of target-rich data, housed in general IT systems and metadata, is information that Veritas already touches with our backup, archive, and storage management solutions. We're uniquely positioned to bring these together to provide companies with access to information that drives informed decision-making.",https://www.naukri.com/job-listings-veritas-sr-quality-engineer-npi-sustaining-veritas-software-technologies-india-pvt-ltd-pune-bengaluru-bangalore-10-to-18-years-120620006085?src=jobsearchDesk&sid=15919744144945150&xp=19&px=7
